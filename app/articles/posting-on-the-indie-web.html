          <h3>What is the IndieWeb?</h3>
          <p>
            I first saw the internet in the early to mid 90s. I sat down at my
            uncle's computer, clicked the AOL desktop icon, and heard the light
            screeching of the modem trying to connect to the system. I didn't
            know it then but it was the beginning of not only my favorite place
            but also how I'd make money as a real adult.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was in high school, about a decade or so after my first AOL
            experience, I took some class on HTML. I still recall and love to
            recount the first time I opened a web page and was able to
            <em>understand</em> what the web page was saying. It felt like I was
            in on some secret society, that I was in some club that offered
            unspeakable power. It was this first reading and understanding of
            the source that put this desire to not only <i>be</i> online but to
            be <em>apart</em> of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was in the times where you'd publish on AngelFire or GeoCities;
            where you'd have a custom layout and theme for your Xanga and
            LiveJournals; where you'd be able to show your Top 8 Friends in your
            custom theme that always had silly, teenage comments hidden in the
            source code. There were no rules, no real consequences for writing
            or saying things in this Third Space. It was the wild west and as
            someone coming into their own at this time, I felt like this was
            <i>my space</i>, a place where I <i>belonged</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            That sense of <i>wonder</i> and <i>excitement</i> that drew me in to
            this Internet thing in the first place is the same sense I get when
            I started looking into the
            <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank">IndieWeb</a>: some
            place that I can be <em>myself</em> and that has
            <em>unlimited</em> potential. If, and this is a big if, we want to
            put in the effort and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IndieWeb isn't really <i>a</i> thing but more a grouping of
            ideals and processes that are aimed at helping us, the citizens of
            the Internet, use it in a way that serves <em>us</em> instead of a
            select few. Their homepage says it best:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites,
            connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning
            your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your
            own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It isn't some app or website that you go to, interact with, and that
            can (and will) do whatever they want with the data those
            interactions generate. The IndieWeb instead flips this paradigm on
            its head and reverts us back to how the Internet worked before
            Walled Gardens became the norm.
          </p>
          <p>
            It offers ways to build your <i>own</i> online presence in a way
            that is interoperable with others. It includes the use of
            <a href="https://webmention.net/" target="_blank">Webmentions</a>
            and
            <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE" target="_blank">Syndication</a
            >, ensuring that your interaction with the Internet is done on
            <i>your</i> site, even if that interaction is in reference to, or
            will be posted on, something outside of it. In my mind, it offers
            <i>all</i> of the things that our Walled Garden systems offer but in
            a way that allows <em>me</em> the ability to <em>own</em> those
            things. Which leads us perfectly into the next section
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Why the IndieWeb?</h3>
        </section>
        <p>
          Every time you post on a Walled Garden application such as Facebook or
          Twitter, you are giving them money. Not directly but by giving up your
          data in exchange for the <i>opportunity</i> to engage with others.
          They make <em>billions of dollars</em> from you and they still don't
          promise that the people that you want to see your content will
          (shadowban and algorithmic feeds). There's a word to use for this sort
          of arragement: parasitical.
        </p>
        <p>
          What value does Facebook actively offer you? What value does Twitter
          actually give you at the end of the day? I got off Facebook years ago
          and haven't missed a single life update from my friends or family. I
          still get cute baby photos from my friends. I left Twitter earlier
          this year and haven't missed any newsworthy event and am still
          up-to-date with all the buzzwords in tech. Nothing other than how I
          spend my free time has changed. And I am of the mind that it changed
          for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I've taken a step back from these Walled Gardens, I haven't lost
          anything. So what did they offer me in exchange for becoming the most
          powerful and wealthy companies in the history of mankind? What is the
          actual deal they are offering us if, when removed from my life, there
          is no appreciable difference? The more I retrospect and introspect,
          the more I realize that these Walled Gardens are just drug dealers:
          offering a small hit of dopamine in exchange for more money that I can
          even imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Internet that I fell in love with wasn't Walled Gardens; it was
          scrappy websites with marquee headlines and stars following the cursor
          around the page. It was <i>personal</i> not just personal information.
          It made me want to invest in it, not drive division between us. The
          Internet is the single biggest advacement of freedom and agency that
          we as humans have ever experienced. Using Walled Gardens as your entry
          point is like having the whole discography of your favorite band at
          your fingertips and only listening to a single song on repeat through
          the wall while a chainsaw revs next to you.

          <h3>How to Join?</h3>
          <p>
            This is the easy part: just build a website! I know, for someone
            that has been building websites for almost 20 years now, that is an
            easy thing to say. But it isn't as difficult as you may think. With
            WordPress and other CMS systems, it is as easy as a few clicks of a
            button and you're off to the races. $10 a year for a domain name and
            $5 per month to rent a server. You won't be winning any tech awards
            but you will be able to serve your Notes and pages with ease.
            However, to be "apart" of the IndieWeb, you'll need to use some
            common building blocks or Microformats to help others consume your
            website in a common way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using
            <a href="http://microformats.org/" target="_blank">Microformats</a>
            is easy if you're using a CMS like WordPress as they will almost
            always have a plugin of some sort to do it automatically for you.
            If, like me, you miss the days of hand-writing HTML, Microformats
            are just classes you add to your markup so that other tooling can
            consume it. Go ahead and look at the source of this website and its
            pages. You'll see <span class="code">p-xxx</span> and
            <span class="code">u-xxx</span> classes added to things. Those
            classes tell other machines what type of data it is and allows them
            to consume and understand the pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's it! There are <em>many, many, many</em> other things we
            can and as I learn more and explore this new frontier, I'll be sure
            to be posting about what I find here. But just this first step of
            getting out of the Walled Gardens and putting my data on my own site
            has given me such hope and excitement for the future. If we start to
            see that the Internet is better <i>without</i> the Gatekeepers and
            Walled Gardens, maybe we can use it to better ourselves and our
            neighbors. Like all technology should be.
