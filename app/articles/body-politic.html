        <h2>Facts on the Ground</h2>
        <p>
          Before we begin, there’s some ideologies and beliefs that I have that
          are foundational to this discussion and are the basis for any of the
          points I try to make. These ideologies use words that, like so much in
          life, can be used in different ways or words that each of us may use
          to mean different things. To ensure that we’re all on the same page,
          I’d like to explore and define some of these.
        </p>
        <h3>Agency</h3>
        <p>
          I believe, without question, that every human is born with the
          physical freedom to do what they please. There are
          <em>social consequences</em> to doing things and others have the same
          freedom as you so this isn’t to say that <em>you</em> can be a dick
          cheese and everyone else has to <em>deal with it</em>. This is to say
          that you, as a human on this Earth, only answer to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hobbes and Rousseau called out this idea, with Rousseau saying it best
          I feel:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Man’s first law is to watch over his own preservation; his first
            care he owes to himself; and as soon as he reaches the age of
            reason, he becomes the only judge of the best means to preserve
            himself; he becomes his own master.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 2</strong></em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Any rules or regulations that we put onto ourselves <em>past</em> this
          are all social and fabricated but should not and can not remove this
          agency. Rousseau goes even further in saying that, due to this
          inherent agency, we are <em>unable</em> to sign it over without losing
          our inherent nature:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To renounce freedom is to renounce one’s humanity, one’s rights as a
            man and equally one’s duties. There is no possible
            <em>quid pro quo</em> for one who renounces everything; indeed such
            renunciation is contrary to man’s very nature; for if you take away
            all freedom of the will, you strip a man’s actions of all moral
            significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 4</strong></em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This fact is the basis for all other things in my world view. Without
          this agency, without this free will to make the choices that you think
          are best for you, none of the other things become possible. As such, I
          want to dive into the <em>consequences</em> of this to ensure that I
          am clear on what this means.
        </p>
        <h4>Agency Means: Your body, your choice</h4>
        <p>
          This doesn’t just mean that you get to decide what cells are inside
          your body and what ones you want out. This means that if you want to
          do crack cocaine in your private, air-tight room, you get to get as
          high as you want. Your body, your choice.
        </p>
        <h4>Agency Means: Their body, their choice</h4>
        <p>
          Others have complete agency over themselves. Full stop. Every person
          is responsible for themselves and is the only arbitrartor on if a
          specific action towards them is acceptable or not. If someone asks to
          be called “Foo” instead of “Bar”, they have the right to be called
          “Foo”.
        </p>
        <h3>The Group</h3>
        <p>
          These two facts lead to an interesting question: Where does
          <em>my</em> agency end and <em>your</em> agency begin? If you wanted
          me to call you “Foo”, under what <em>right</em> do you have to
          <em>limit my choice of words</em>? How come <em>your</em> agency
          overrides <em>my</em> agency? Why can’t <em>I</em> tell you that
          <em>you</em> must go by “Bar” instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          In nature, according to Rousseau, you <em>don’t</em> have that right.
          We only have domain over, and only are governed by, ourselves and our
          own moral compass. You <em>cannot make me</em> call you “Foo” if I
          want to use “Bar” instead. Neither can I make you
          <em>listen to me</em> call you “Bar” if you don’t want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This agency, as we can see, breaks down when there’s more than one
          person. We can all agree, and I think we all do, that having complete
          agency is ideal and natural. We are born free to move our limbs, free
          to have a thought, free to form words with our mouths. But once we get
          around anyone else, that freedom runs into other’s freedom. How do we
          ensure that I can retain my agency while respecting that of others?
          How can I be free to ensure my survival if what I <em>know</em> to be
          the key to it is something that <em>interferes</em> with yours?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not getting into the discussion of <em>if</em> those two things
          are true; if I <em>really and truly believe</em> that I
          <em>must</em> call you “Bar” and you
          <em>really and truly believe</em> that I must call you “Foo”. I agree
          that there are some people that play Devil’s Advocate and are
          contradictory just because that is their nature. And it is
          <em>within their agency to truly feel that way</em>! Instead of trying
          to say that <em>some</em> things are true and others are merely
          <em>that person being a troll</em>, I think we must take others at
          face value and if they say that calling you “Bar” is the only thing
          keeping them alive, even if <em>we</em> disagree, then we behave and
          treat them <em>as if that were true</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your agency truly depends on a lack of my agency, where do we land?
          In a world without societies, without <em>social contracts</em> as
          described by Hobbes or Rousseau, it is the strongest that gets to
          define what the rules are and others must either obey or be consumed
          by the strong. We have the agency to tell others to call us “Foo” but
          they have the agency to kill us and put “Bar” on our tombstone. This
          is less than ideal for the individual, even the strong ones, for your
          agency, your ability to seek betterment, is tied to your vigor and
          strength, both qualities that are fleeting and difficult to keep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over and over again, humans have seen this and have built societies in
          order to find strength in numbers. These societies, which I call
          Groups, are in and of themselves <em>things</em> that we can treat as
          if it were an individual, with Agency and Freedom similar to that of a
          single actor. <em>Outside</em> these groups the power of might is
          still active, there is still no concrete, well established way to
          <em>fairly</em> decide if you <em>have to be</em> called “Bar” over
          “Foo”. <em>Inside</em> of the group, however, is a completely
          different story.
        </p>
        <h3>The Social Contract</h3>
        <p>
          Hobbes talks about this natural state, or <em>war</em> as he described
          it:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            […] the state of men without civil society (which state we may
            properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of
            all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              ><strong
                >Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth
                Ecclesiasticall and Civil</strong
              ></em
            >
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We as animals are smart enough to realize this and to form groups in
          order to protect ourselves from those that are at war with us. The
          scientific reasons for why we as humans are draw to societies such as
          gene selection or mutual altruism, as discussed in
          <em><strong>The Moral Animal</strong></em
          >, isn’t the focus of this work. Instead I’d like to ask
          <em>what then?</em> If we are, in nature, at war with each other, and
          we find solace in a group, what then are we to say about that paradox
          of agency? <em>What</em> society should we then cling to or
          <em>how</em> might we settle the debate of if you
          <em>have to be</em> called “Foo” or “Bar”.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>We</em> decide, as a Group, how. There is not an arbitrator, some
          authority or soverign <em>outside</em> of the Group to petition to; no
          force outside of the Group that we can call upon for all outside of
          the Group are, naturally, at war with the Group and the individuals
          that comprise it. The only way for us to decide on if you are called
          “Foo” or “Bar” is to decide, as a Group, if you are or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          How then does the Group decide? Is it popular vote via direct
          democracy? Via a selected aristocracy or perhaps a dictatorship of the
          people? As there is no <em>higher power than the Group</em>, that
          answer is only possible <em>from the Group itself</em>. But this
          higher power than ourselves contradicts the
          <a href="#facts-on-the-ground">facts</a> that I started this work
          with: that I as a human have agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I have complete agency to do as I please, how can I give that up in
          order to be a part of a larger whole?
        </p>
        <p>Rousseau answers:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            How to find a form of association which will defined the person and
            goods of each member with the collective force of all, and under
            which each individual, while uniting himself with the others, obeys
            no one but himself, and remains as free as before. This is the
            fundamental problem to which the
            <strong>social contract</strong> holds the solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 6</strong></em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          What is this <em>social contract</em>? What is the resolution to this
          paradox of agency?
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            These articles of association, rightly understood, are reducible to
            a single one, namely the total alienation by each associate of
            himself and all his rights to the whole community.
          </p>
          <p>[…]</p>
          <p>
            Each one of us puts into the community his person and all his powers
            under the supreme direction of the general will; and as a body, we
            incorporate every member as an indvisible part of the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 6</strong></em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We give up <em>ourselves and our self-driven desires</em> to the Group
          completely and, in turn, the Group makes decisions that are in the
          best interest of <em>every member of the Group</em>. Just as you
          decide to cut your toe nails or trim your hair, so too can the Group
          decide what actions are best made for and against the
          <em>very well-being</em> of an individual.
        </p>
        <h2>This is Reality</h2>
        <p>
          This isn’t to say that in an ideal world we would live like bees or
          ants. That point will come in a later work. This is to describe
          <em>what is currently true</em> today in any society or even familial
          unit. The State has the right to take from you in taxes, to force you
          into confinement in jail, and to remove you from your family with
          child separation. There is currently, no matter where you live, some
          form of a Group that has complete and utter control over you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This concept of a social contract is not a prescription of how we
          <em>should</em> be but rather a description of how <em>we are</em>.
          <em>What then</em> are we to do about that? <em>Now what?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I posit that we live this truly. We accept that we are merely a piece
          of a larger whole and we <em>work as a Group</em> to better not only
          ourselves but the <em>future of the Group</em>. We make decisions
          rationally and purposefully to <em>better the Group</em>. We act as a
          Group instead of as individuals.
        </p>
        <h3>How One Might Want to Live</h3>
        <p>
          While I cannot tell <em>other</em> Groups how they should live, I
          <em>can</em> describe for my Group the rules that I want to live by;
          the governing body that <em>I</em> am willing to subjugate myself to.
          I make no effort to convert you into my Group but am excited to find
          others that are willing to be a part and write this ideology to
          inspire others to work together for <em>something</em> bigger than the
          war, full of awe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should give over ourselves to the Group. All that we have, all that
          we are, towards this Group. For what gain does my own growth in this
          war bring me other than more battles to be fought? But if my own self
          identity is the Group, what is possible in not only
          <em>my</em> lifetime but millennia after?
        </p>
        <p>
          I will call you “Bar” today, “Baz” tomorrow, and won’t speak to you
          the next, if that is what you need to feel accepted and complete in
          this Group. Your identity as an individual is important just like the
          toe and its pain is the pain of the whole body and must be addressed
          by the whole body.
        </p>
        <p>
          You <em>are</em> the body, just as <em>I</em> am the body. We may be
          different appendages but we are all the <em>same</em> thing as
          <em>we see our identity as the Group</em> not as the
          <em>individuals that are a part of it</em>. We are the trees, yes, but
          we identify as the forest. I will give up my self if you give up
          yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will give up my <em>identity</em> if you give up yours. I will have
          <em>grace</em> with your transgressions if you have <em>grace</em> and
          <em>forgiveness</em> for mine. I will support the Group throughout the
          life of the Group, regardless of how my <em>selfishness</em> may drive
          me elsewhere if, when I faulter, the Group will selfessly bring me
          back into the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could we possibly do as a singular Group? What
          <em>endless awe and wonder</em> are possible if instead of me
          preparing for war with others, I could focus all of my energies into a
          singluar <em>thing</em>, into the betterment of <em>the Group</em>?
          How far could <em>we</em> grow?
        </p>
        <p>
          This ideal is, for all intent and purpose, impossible for a group of 7
          billion people, 300 million, or even 300 thousand. I accept that my
          Group will not and probably could not ever be the <em>only</em> Group.
          I support others finding their own rules and dogma to follow and give
          themselves over to. I will respect that they will always call me “Foo”
          no matter how much I prefer “Bar”. They are not a part of my Group but
          have every right to form their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see the pragmatic answer being that just like I myself give up total
          control to my Group, so too shall many Groups give themselves over to
          form larger ones. This is a republic, formed by many smaller
          city-states or similar divisional providences. I am not trying to
          describe a “more perfect union” nor am I of the illusion that this is
          a novel idea. I do believe, however, if that we were honest and open
          with <em>each other Groups</em>, we would find these ideals playing
          out in much more robust and fruitful ways. If instead of us seeing the
          <em>body politic</em> being a zero-sum game, we saw it as a place for
          us to compromise and form better <em>social contracts</em> in place of
          <em>war</em>, we would find that there is room for all people to have
          full agency, regardless of how that may or may not be amenable to any
          certain group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of trying to describe the meta-Group, I am trying to describe
          <em>my</em> specific Group. I do not nor can not describe
          <em>your</em> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that my Group should be based solely on Grace and
          Acceptance. We should not fall into the trap of intolerance, even if
          that means we must be tolerant of intolerance. Even if that means that
          any one individual should be hurt or even killed. Just as the toe may
          be cut off if it is too far broken, so too shall the Group accept the
          death of an individual if that means the Group grows and lives. The
          Group <em>must</em> be pacifist and practice
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa">ahimsa</a> or
          nonviolence. There is no other option that ensures that
          <em>we</em> are not selfish and that <em>we</em> do not take away
          others agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must “cause no injury”. We must “turn the other cheek”. There is no
          possible way for me and my understanding of the world, to reconcile
          other’s agency with mine. We must accept disrespect, for enforcing
          others, outside of our Group, into anything, is an act of selfishness
          and selfishness hinders us from indentifying as a Group and
          <em>only as</em> the Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must die to ourselves daily and accept a plight in life that is
          counter to our own self interests.
        </p>
        <h3>My Own Hypocrisy</h3>
        <p>
          I do not turn the other cheek. I am selfish and quite possibly the
          <em>most selfish</em> person I know. I am the least able to do this
          and the most in need of the Grace and Acceptance that I proport to be
          the basic tenants of my Group. And it is this <em>very point</em> that
          drives <em>my need</em> of a Group built upon these tenants.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are to say that if you are racist you will be removed from the
          love of the Group, then I am to be removed from the Group for I am the
          most racist person I know. If we are to say that if you cause others
          harm you are to be removed, than I daily am to be chastised and cut
          off for I say mean things and think harmful things every time I
          interact with others. If we are to say those that have disrespected
          others are to be ineligible for acceptance at our Thanksgiving table,
          I am the first to be removed from the guest list for I fall short of
          this in all of my interactions and when I don’t it is because other’s
          desire for respect just so happens to coincide with my own world view
          of how I should live.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>only way</em> I can subjugate myself totally and utterly to a
          Group is to have a Group that will accept those that are
          <em>pieces of shit</em> for I myself, in all and ever way,
          <em><strong>am a piece of shit</strong></em
          >. I lie, cheat, and steal in order to preserve myself; I take capital
          away from those that need it; I have more than I need to survive; I am
          the cause of other people’s suffering and possibly death if we take
          the gobal economy and/or butterfly effect to its final conclusions. If
          we are to say that <em>we</em> can have a Group, I am only able to
          <em>join</em> a Group that allows the outcasts, the sinners, the
          Enemies of the Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          How am I able to <em>be an equal part</em> of a Group if that Group
          doesn’t accept me <em>for who I am?</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Tim on a Path</h2>
        <p>
          The point of this project is to find out <em>where</em> that Group is
          and to build that Group if we cannot find it elsewhere. For the older
          I get, the less of this war I want with my fellow man and more of the
          peace that I see being a part of the forest brings. Now that I am able
          to <em>survive</em>, I yearn for a place for me to <em>thrive</em>.
          Not only for my lifetime but for my childrens and their grandchildren.
        </p>
        <p>
          The person I am today, the Group I dedicate my life to, will shape the
          universe in ways that I can not phathom. More immediately it will
          affect those around me and will drive them towards or away from what I
          said is my ideal world. It is my duty as a rational actor to design my
          lifestyle around this and to view my actions in light of this; I must
          choose the path that I wish the Group to live even when that path will
          hurt my <em>individual</em> feelings or livelihood, if it’s in order
          to better the Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t propose to <em>know</em> anything. As we grow and find more
          influences, my views will change and I will evolve into a different
          person. I ask, if you are to follow for a day or for a lifetime, that
          you have Grace and Acceptance for me. Call me out when I do you harm
          and call me home when you need a Group to support you.
          <em><strong>I am a piece of shit</strong></em> and my words will be
          out of place, incorrect, and harmful. That is something I am working
          on and any Group that has power over me will understand that. I ask
          that you have love for me and allow me to repent and pay penitence for
          my actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do mean that the Group is more important than me, even when I am
          unable to act that way.
        </p>
        <h2>What Next?</h2>
        <p>
          Now we explore what the Group should look like and take an honest look
          into ourselves and compare how we currently are with how we believe
          the Group should act and focus our lives around changing anything that
          falls short and investing in anything that already has alignment. We
          have as our tenant Grace and Acceptance for that is a prerequisite for
          any Group we <em>can</em> be a part of. What does that actively mean?
          If we were to imagine a perfect example of the Group, what does any
          individual of that Group look like?
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t know and I think that’s a good place for us to start this
          discussion. This post and all others have
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmentions</a> enabled.
          You can find that information in the markup of the site along with
          <a href="/docs/sending-web-mention">tutorials</a> on how to send one
          once you have the URL for <code>target</code>. If you have any ideas
          on what that individual looks like, or possibly where we might start
          our exploration of other people’s prior search for this same question,
          create a post about it and send me a Webmention. I’d love to explore
          this with you and learn from you on how our Group can grow and become
          <em>something</em>.
