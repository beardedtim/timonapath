<h2>My Rebirth</h2>
<p>When I was 25 or so I was pushing my friend in a hammock tied to
the tree at my childhood home, reading some book probably from Alan
Watts or Kant, trying to look smart. I read quote after quote, rocking
the hammock back and forth softly with each stanza.</p>
<p>I had just come back home after trying to live in San Francisco
with no real job, education, or any real tangible skill; all for a girl
that, even before I moved out there, had made it abundantly clear that she did not feel
the same. Mania makes one do funny things and a life of emptiness is a
great lubricant for mistakes.</p>
<p>My whole life once I got back from The City was dedicated to filling the
<em>hole</em> that this girl, this unrequited love had tried and failed to fill. Having
been brought up in a Christian household and having left the Church the moment
my parents stopped making me go, I was drawn towards the Eastern philosophies
of the Tao and Buddhism.</p>
<p>I read and listened to Alan Watts daily. I poured over Western and Eastern
philosphy books, ebbing in and out of each one as I searched for <em>some answer</em>,
some <em>fulfillment</em>. I was a rabid dog trying to fill an unsatiable desire.
I wasn’t understanding anything but I was <em>searching</em> and <em>trying</em>.</p>
<p>It was as I was pushing my friend that it <em>clicked</em>. All at once but as if
I had known it all along and a <em>fog had been lifted</em> I <em>understood something</em>.</p>
<p>This tree I pushed my friend on had a massive trunk with roots weaving in and out
of the dirt around the tree, all the way to the house’s foundation. The trunk
split, about 3-4 feet above the ground, into two main segments. Each of those
segments broke into an innumerable amount of branches, each branch with an
innumerable amount of twigs, each twig with an innumerable amount of leaves.</p>
<p>Things made up of Things made up of Things.</p>
<p>Looking at that tree, three questions and their answers became more clear than
they ever had before. And I changed, fundamentally becoming a different person.</p>
<h3>What is a Tree?</h3>
<p>If I cut all of the branches off, ripped up the roots and quartered them, splicing
all the leaves into a million pieces, would I still have a tree?
If I just cut it in half <em>before</em> it got to the two large segments, with the
roots below and <em>everything else</em> above, would either piece be a <em>tree</em>?</p>
<p>If the tree is <em>one thing</em>, a <em>thing</em> that is made up of <em>other things</em>, then
when a branch gets diseased and the tree stops sending it nutrients, is that
a <em>bad</em> thing? Is it <em>bad for the tree</em> that all of the leaves die every year?
Is it <em>bad</em> that these living organisms are being destroyed in order for the
<em>tree</em> and <em>only the tree</em> to survive?</p>
<h3>Who Owns the Toe?</h3>
<p>When I stub my toe, I think to myself and say outloud</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OH MY GOD! MY TOE HURTS SO BADLY!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not say <code>I hurt so badly</code>. I say <em>my toe</em>.</p>
<p>We <em>possess</em> the toe, we <em>own</em> the toe. But ownership means there is a separation
of the thing being owned and the owner. We possess the <em>pain</em> but we do not say
that the pain is <em>a part</em> of us. We <em>experience</em> it. Who is <em>experiencing</em> and
<em>what</em> are they experiencing?</p>
<h3>What is a Forest?</h3>
<p>Just like a tree is a grouping of <em>things</em>, a forest is a <em>thing</em> that we associate
with <em>some grouping of things</em>. In fact, you cannot have a <em>tree</em> and a <em>forest</em> at
the same time. You can have a <em>forest</em> or you can have <em>many trees</em>. Just like you
cannot have a twig and a tree at the same time. To take the twig out of the tree,
it no longer is a tree, it is a twig. Even pointing out a leaf on a tree, the leaf
stops to be <em>a part</em> of the tree and instead becomes <em>a thing</em> separate from the
<em>other thing</em>.</p>
<p>Just like a forest, <em>I am a grouping of things</em>. Each <em>thing</em> can be dissected
and labeled and named and presented by itself but <em>none of those things are Me</em>.
I am <em>all of those things</em> yet I am <em>a thing</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a young man who said though, it seems that I know that I know, but what I would
like to see is the I that knows me when I know that I know that I know.</p>
<p>Alan Watts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three of these questions keep revealing even deeper and deeper answers the more
I study and search. I am not a teacher but these questions, these <em>koans</em>, are what
have guided me for almost 10 years now. Every piece of new information, every new
“epiphany” that I have is filtered through these three questions and their answers.
Each time I do, I find more fulfillment, more enrichment in my life. These koans
and their answers are the <em>meaning I have found</em> that fills that <em>void</em> I was
searching for.</p>
<p>Not to bury the lede but I do not have a good answer for any of those questions. I
have the answer in the way <em>I understand</em> it and these writings are a way for me to
clarify what I <em>mean</em> when I say these answers, but I do not think that I have <em>any
answers for those questions</em> or put better way I don’t think that <em>my answers</em> are any
better or worse than <em>your answers</em>. In my mind, the <em>questions</em> and the <em>seeking</em>
are the actual <em>thing</em> I’m pointing at.</p>
<p>But. A question asked is owed an answer, however unsatisfying.</p>
<p>All three of these questions lead me to believe two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not the electrical impulses that course through my nervous system</li>
<li>You and I are the same thing, in the same way that two trees are a part of
the same forest</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you and I are, whoever <em>owns the toe</em>, we are the <em>same thing</em>,
in the same way that the two large segments <em>are the same tree</em>, in the same
way that <em>two trees are a forest</em>.</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>Philosophy does no good if we cannot take something away from it. Anyone can
spout off $5 words in a sentence that has some punctuation. How might one
want to live given these ideas?</p>
<p><a href="https://timonapath.com/articles/body-politic">My previous work</a> outlined the
consequences of this, where the Group is the most important thing, but I want
to dive into that a little deeper and ask a few more questions, hoping to shed
light on the consequences of this way of thinking.</p>
<h3>There Are No Trees</h3>
<p>I cannot express this enough: <strong>You are not important</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I am not important</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Tree is important. The Forest is important</strong></em></p>
<p>If the Group is all that matters, my agency is not directed by what makes me <em>happy</em> or
what limits <em>my</em> pain and suffering <em>as a leaf</em>. My agency is <em>that of the Tree</em>. I am
<em>nothing outside of the Tree</em>. <em>I am nothing but the Tree</em>. I am <em>not my toe</em>, my <em>toe is me</em>.</p>
<p>A sick leaf gets nutrients. A hurt leg gets healed. A cancer gets removed. A broken
twig gets blown away. The Tree lives on. The Tree and the outcome of the Tree is what we
<em>yearn</em> for, what we <em>focus on</em>, and what we <em>judge our circumstances against</em>. We are not
individuals, we are The Group; there are no individuals.</p>
<p>This ideology can, and has, been used to hurt others, to take from others, and to keep others
subjugated to misery and turmoil. Just like the output of photosynthesis can give you diabetes
but also gives life to <em>everything on earth</em>, so too can this ideology be used <em>against</em> the
Tree itself. I do not know how to stop that from happening.</p>
<p>I do not know how to design a system that ensures that <em>when I suffer</em> it is purely and
totally for the <em>Tree’s benefit</em>. I do not have a way to tell you directly what is The Tree
and what is the Branch; I cannot tell you how to discern the needs of the Forest when all you
can hear is the Tree itself yelling; I cannot explain how because I do not know how.</p>
<p>What I can say, and what I have found most helpful, is that <em>others have asked these questions</em>.
How to support The Tree, the Self, the One that Is, is all that religion is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, we who look at the whole and not just the part, know that we too are systems of interdependence,
of feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and consciousness all interconnected. Investigating in this way, we
come to realize that there is no me or mine in any one part, just as a sound does not belong to any one part of the lute.</p>
<p>Gautama Buddha</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from
me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers;
such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit,
showing yourselves to be my disciples.</p>
<p>Jesus of Nazareth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search these words, but when you search do not search for <em>comfort</em> or <em>escape</em> from your duties but to
<em>understand your duties</em> as part of the Tree. Meditate daily on what the Tree needs from you today, on
what your body needs from you right now.</p>
<h3>You are a Tree</h3>
<p>This <em><strong>does not mean</strong></em> that you don’t matter. In the previous work, we start from the <em>foundational</em>
concept that You have complete agency over You. You <em>matter</em>, your feelings are <em>important and valid</em>. You
can feel and want and need <em>whatever it is that you think you want or feel or need</em>.</p>
<p>I <em>need</em> food and water. I <em>need</em> my wife. I <em>need</em> to be loved.</p>
<p>All of these needs <em>deserve to be fulfilled</em> by any metric of deserve. It is <em>truly and utterly unfair</em> that
you and I do not live in a perfect world without pain, without suffering, without need, without want. We
<em>should and can</em> fight for a world where <em>we are fulfilled</em>. You matter and deserve to feel however you want
to feel. However.</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do to <em>ensure we are fulfilled</em>. There is nothing we can <em>push onto others</em> that would
make the next moment a given, nothing we can <em>take from others</em> that would give us another minute in our life’s
hour glass. We are born without consultation and we die much the same. What makes us think that anything in the
middle would be different?</p>
<p>We are a Tree, with all of its importance. But we are in a Forest, on an Earth, in a Solar System, in a Universe.
The Tree matters just like the grain of sand matters to the beach. The sorrows of the sand are the sorrows of the
beach, the same as your sorrows are that of the universe.</p>
<p>But a Tree must die in order for the Forest to live. A leaf must die in order for the Tree to live. I must die
in order for You to live. We must die in order for Us to live.</p>
