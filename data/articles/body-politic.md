## Facts on the Ground

Before we begin, there's some ideologies and beliefs that I have that are foundational
to this discussion and are the basis for any of the points I try to make. These ideologies
use words that, like so much in life, can be used in different ways or words that each of us
may use to mean different things. To ensure that we're all on the same page, I'd like to explore
and define some of these.

### Agency

I believe, without question, that every human is born with the physical freedom to do what they
please. There are _social consequences_ to doing things and others have the same freedom as you
so this isn't to say that _you_ can be a dick cheese and everyone else has to _deal with it_.
This is to say that you, as a human on this Earth, only answer to yourself.

Hobbes and Rousseau called out this idea, with Rousseau saying it best I feel:

> Man's first law is to watch over his own preservation; his first care
> he owes to himself; and as soon as he reaches the age of reason, he
> becomes the only judge of the best means to preserve himself; he
> becomes his own master.
>
> _**The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 2**_

Any rules or regulations that we put onto ourselves _past_ this are all social and fabricated but
should not and can not remove this agency. Rousseau goes even further in saying that, due to this
inherent agency, we are _unable_ to sign it over without losing our inherent nature:

> To renounce freedom is to renounce one's humanity, one's rights as a man
> and equally one's duties. There is no possible _quid pro quo_ for one who
> renounces everything; indeed such renunciation is contrary to man's very nature;
> for if you take away all freedom of the will, you strip a man's actions of all
> moral significance.
>
> _**The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 4**_

This fact is the basis for all other things in my world view. Without this agency, without
this free will to make the choices that you think are best for you, none of the other things
become possible. As such, I want to dive into the _consequences_ of this to ensure that I am
clear on what this means.

#### Agency Means: Your body, your choice

This doesn't just mean that you get to decide what cells are inside your body and what ones
you want out. This means that if you want to do crack cocaine in your private, air-tight
room, you get to get as high as you want. Your body, your choice.

#### Agency Means: Their body, their choice

Others have complete agency over themselves. Full stop. Every person is responsible for
themselves and is the only arbitrartor on if a specific action towards them is acceptable or
not. If someone asks to be called "Foo" instead of "Bar", they have the right to be called
"Foo".

### The Group

These two facts lead to an interesting question: Where does _my_ agency end and _your_ agency
begin? If you wanted me to call you "Foo", under what _right_ do you have to
_limit my choice of words_? How come _your_ agency overrides _my_ agency? Why can't _I_ tell you
that _you_ must go by "Bar" instead?

In nature, according to Rousseau, you _don't_ have that right. We only have domain over, and only
are governed by, ourselves and our own moral compass. You _cannot make me_ call you "Foo" if I want
to use "Bar" instead. Neither can I make you _listen to me_ call you "Bar" if you don't want to.

This agency, as we can see, breaks down when there's more than one person. We can all agree,
and I think we all do, that having complete agency is ideal and natural. We are born free to move
our limbs, free to have a thought, free to form words with our mouths. But once we get around anyone else,
that freedom runs into other's freedom. How do we ensure that I can retain my agency while respecting that
of others? How can I be free to ensure my survival if what I _know_ to be the key to it is something that
_interferes_ with yours?

I am not getting into the discussion of _if_ those two things are true; if I _really and truly believe_
that I _must_ call you "Bar" and you _really and truly believe_ that I must call you "Foo". I agree
that there are some people that play Devil's Advocate and are contradictory just because that is their
nature. And it is _within their agency to truly feel that way_! Instead of trying to say that _some_ things
are true and others are merely _that person being a troll_, I think we must take others at face value and
if they say that calling you "Bar" is the only thing keeping them alive, even if _we_ disagree, then we
behave and treat them _as if that were true_.

If your agency truly depends on a lack of my agency, where do we land? In a world without societies,
without _social contracts_ as described by Hobbes or Rousseau, it is the strongest that gets to define what
the rules are and others must either obey or be consumed by the strong. We have the agency to tell others
to call us "Foo" but they have the agency to kill us and put "Bar" on our tombstone. This is less than
ideal for the individual, even the strong ones, for your agency, your ability to seek betterment, is tied
to your vigor and strength, both qualities that are fleeting and difficult to keep.

Over and over again, humans have seen this and have built societies in order to find strength in
numbers. These societies, which I call Groups, are in and of themselves _things_ that we can treat
as if it were an individual, with Agency and Freedom similar to that of a single actor. _Outside_ these
groups the power of might is still active, there is still no concrete, well established way to _fairly_
decide if you _have to be_ called "Bar" over "Foo". _Inside_ of the group, however, is a completely
different story.

### The Social Contract

Hobbes talks about this natural state, or _war_ as he described it:

> [...] the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is
> nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.
>
> _**Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil**_

We as animals are smart enough to realize this and to form groups in order to protect ourselves from those
that are at war with us. The scientific reasons for why we as humans are draw to societies such as gene
selection or mutual altruism, as discussed in _**The Moral Animal**_, isn't the focus of this work. Instead
I'd like to ask _what then?_ If we are, in nature, at war with each other, and we find solace in a group,
what then are we to say about that paradox of agency? _What_ society should we then cling to or _how_
might we settle the debate of if you _have to be_ called "Foo" or "Bar".

_We_ decide, as a Group, how. There is not an arbitrator, some authority or soverign _outside_ of the
Group to petition to; no force outside of the Group that we can call upon for all outside of the Group
are, naturally, at war with the Group and the individuals that comprise it. The only way for us to
decide on if you are called "Foo" or "Bar" is to decide, as a Group, if you are or not.

How then does the Group decide? Is it popular vote via direct democracy? Via a selected aristocracy or
perhaps a dictatorship of the people? As there is no _higher power than the Group_, that answer is only
possible _from the Group itself_. But this higher power than ourselves contradicts the
[facts](#facts-on-the-ground) that I started this work with: that I as a human have agency.

If I have complete agency to do as I please, how can I give that up in order to be a part of a larger
whole?

Rousseau answers:

> How to find a form of association which will defined the person and goods of each member with the
> collective force of all, and under which each individual, while uniting himself with the others,
> obeys no one but himself, and remains as free as before. This is the fundamental problem to which
> the **social contract** holds the solution.
>
> _**The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 6**_

What is this _social contract_? What is the resolution to this paradox of agency?

> These articles of association, rightly understood, are reducible to a single one, namely the total
> alienation by each associate of himself and all his rights to the whole community.
>
> [...]
>
> Each one of us puts into the community his person and all his powers under the supreme direction of
> the general will; and as a body, we incorporate every member as an indvisible part of the whole.
>
> _**The Social Contract Book 1, Chapter 6**_

We give up _ourselves and our self-driven desires_ to the Group completely and, in turn, the Group makes
decisions that are in the best interest of _every member of the Group_. Just as you decide to cut your
toe nails or trim your hair, so too can the Group decide what actions are best made for and against the
_very well-being_ of an individual.

## This is Reality

This isn't to say that in an ideal world we would live like bees or ants. That point will come in a later
work. This is to describe _what is currently true_ today in any society or even familial unit. The State
has the right to take from you in taxes, to force you into confinement in jail, and to remove you from
your family with child separation. There is currently, no matter where you live, some form of a Group that
has complete and utter control over you.

This concept of a social contract is not a prescription of how we _should_ be but rather a description of
how _we are_. _What then_ are we to do about that? _Now what?_

I posit that we live this truly. We accept that we are merely a piece of a larger whole and we
_work as a Group_ to better not only ourselves but the _future of the Group_. We make decisions rationally
and purposefully to _better the Group_. We act as a Group instead of as individuals.

### How One Might Want to Live

While I cannot tell _other_ Groups how they should live, I _can_ describe for my Group the rules that I
want to live by; the governing body that _I_ am willing to subjugate myself to. I make no effort to
convert you into my Group but am excited to find others that are willing to be a part and write this
ideology to inspire others to work together for _something_ bigger than the war, full of awe.

We should give over ourselves to the Group. All that we have, all that we are, towards this Group. For
what gain does my own growth in this war bring me other than more battles to be fought? But if my own
self identity is the Group, what is possible in not only _my_ lifetime but millennia after?

I will call you "Bar" today, "Baz" tomorrow, and won't speak to you the next, if that is what you need
to feel accepted and complete in this Group. Your identity as an individual is important just like the
toe and its pain is the pain of the whole body and must be addressed by the whole body.

You _are_ the body, just as _I_ am the body. We may be different appendages but we are all the _same_
thing as _we see our identity as the Group_ not as the _individuals that are a part of it_. We are the
trees, yes, but we identify as the forest. I will give up my self if you give up yours.

I will give up my _identity_ if you give up yours. I will have _grace_ with your transgressions if you
have _grace_ and _forgiveness_ for mine. I will support the Group throughout the life of the Group,
regardless of how my _selfishness_ may drive me elsewhere if, when I faulter, the Group will selfessly
bring me back into the fold.

What could we possibly do as a singular Group? What _endless awe and wonder_ are possible if instead
of me preparing for war with others, I could focus all of my energies into a singluar _thing_, into
the betterment of _the Group_? How far could _we_ grow?

This ideal is, for all intent and purpose, impossible for a group of 7 billion people, 300 million, or
even 300 thousand. I accept that my Group will not and probably could not ever be the _only_ Group. I
support others finding their own rules and dogma to follow and give themselves over to. I will respect
that they will always call me "Foo" no matter how much I prefer "Bar". They are not a part of my Group
but have every right to form their own.

I see the pragmatic answer being that just like I myself give up total control to my Group, so too shall
many Groups give themselves over to form larger ones. This is a republic, formed by many smaller
city-states or similar divisional providences. I am not trying to describe a "more perfect union" nor am
I of the illusion that this is a novel idea. I do believe, however, if that we were honest and open with
_each other Groups_, we would find these ideals playing out in much more robust and fruitful ways. If
instead of us seeing the _body politic_ being a zero-sum game, we saw it as a place for us to compromise
and form better _social contracts_ in place of _war_, we would find that there is room for all people to
have full agency, regardless of how that may or may not be amenable to any certain group.

Instead of trying to describe the meta-Group, I am trying to describe _my_ specific Group. I do not nor can
not describe _your_ Group.

I believe that my Group should be based solely on Grace and Acceptance. We should not fall into the trap
of intolerance, even if that means we must be tolerant of intolerance. Even if that means that any one
individual should be hurt or even killed. Just as the toe may be cut off if it is too far broken, so too
shall the Group accept the death of an individual if that means the Group grows and lives. The Group _must_
be pacifist and practice [ahimsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa) or nonviolence. There is no other
option that ensures that _we_ are not selfish and that _we_ do not take away others agency.

We must "cause no injury". We must "turn the other cheek". There is no possible way for me and my
understanding of the world, to reconcile other's agency with mine. We must accept disrespect, for enforcing
others, outside of our Group, into anything, is an act of selfishness and selfishness hinders us from
indentifying as a Group and _only as_ the Group.

We must die to ourselves daily and accept a plight in life that is counter to our own self interests.

### My Own Hypocrisy

I do not turn the other cheek. I am selfish and quite possibly the _most selfish_ person I know. I am
the least able to do this and the most in need of the Grace and Acceptance that I proport to be the basic
tenants of my Group. And it is this _very point_ that drives _my need_ of a Group built upon these
tenants.

If we are to say that if you are racist you will be removed from the love of the Group, then I am to
be removed from the Group for I am the most racist person I know. If we are to say that if you cause others
harm you are to be removed, than I daily am to be chastised and cut off for I say mean things and think
harmful things every time I interact with others. If we are to say those that have disrespected others
are to be ineligible for acceptance at our Thanksgiving table, I am the first to be removed from the
guest list for I fall short of this in all of my interactions and when I don't it is because other's desire
for respect just so happens to coincide with my own world view of how I should live.

The _only way_ I can subjugate myself totally and utterly to a Group is to have a Group that will
accept those that are _pieces of shit_ for I myself, in all and ever way, _**am a piece of shit**_. I lie,
cheat, and steal in order to preserve myself; I take capital away from those that need it; I have more
than I need to survive; I am the cause of other people's suffering and possibly death if we take the gobal
economy and/or butterfly effect to its final conclusions. If we are to say that _we_ can have a Group,
I am only able to _join_ a Group that allows the outcasts, the sinners, the Enemies of the Group.

How am I able to _be an equal part_ of a Group if that Group doesn't accept me _for who I am?_

## Tim on a Path

The point of this project is to find out _where_ that Group is and to build that Group if we cannot find
it elsewhere. For the older I get, the less of this war I want with my fellow man and more of the peace
that I see being a part of the forest brings. Now that I am able to _survive_, I yearn for a place for me
to _thrive_. Not only for my lifetime but for my childrens and their grandchildren.

The person I am today, the Group I dedicate my life to, will shape the universe in ways that I can not
phathom. More immediately it will affect those around me and will drive them towards or away from what I
said is my ideal world. It is my duty as a rational actor to design my lifestyle around this and to view
my actions in light of this; I must choose the path that I wish the Group to live even when that path will
hurt my _individual_ feelings or livelihood, if it's in order to better the Group.

I don't propose to _know_ anything. As we grow and find more influences, my views will change and I will
evolve into a different person. I ask, if you are to follow for a day or for a lifetime, that you
have Grace and Acceptance for me. Call me out when I do you harm and call me home when you need a Group
to support you. _**I am a piece of shit**_ and my words will be out of place, incorrect, and harmful. That
is something I am working on and any Group that has power over me will understand that. I ask that you have
love for me and allow me to repent and pay penitence for my actions.

I do mean that the Group is more important than me, even when I am unable to act that way.

## What Next?

Now we explore what the Group should look like and take an honest look into ourselves and compare how
we currently are with how we believe the Group should act and focus our lives around changing anything that
falls short and investing in anything that already has alignment. We have as our tenant Grace and Acceptance
for that is a prerequisite for any Group we _can_ be a part of. What does that actively mean? If we were to
imagine a perfect example of the Group, what does any individual of that Group look like?

I don't know and I think that's a good place for us to start this discussion. This post and all others
have [Webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) enabled. You can find that information in the
markup of the site along with [tutorials](/docs/sending-web-mention) on how to send one once you
have the URL for `target`. If you have any ideas on what that individual looks like, or possibly where
we might start our exploration of other people's prior search for this same question, create a post about
it and send me a Webmention. I'd love to explore this with you and learn from you on how our Group can grow
and become _something_.
