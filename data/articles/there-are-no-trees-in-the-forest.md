title: There Are No Trees in the Forest
summary: |
  There was a time, before when I was not Self. There
  is still a time where I am not the Self but at least
  now I see that. The more I seek out others that see
  the Self, the more I am hearing about I's.

## My Rebirth

When I was 25 or so I was pushing my friend in a hammock tied to
the tree at my childhood home, reading some book probably from Alan
Watts or Kant, trying to look smart. I read quote after quote, rocking
the hammock back and forth softly with each stanza.

I had just come back home after trying to live in San Francisco
with no real job, education, or any real tangible skill; all for a girl
that, even before I moved out there, had made it abundantly clear that she did not feel
the same. Mania makes one do funny things and a life of emptiness is a
great lubricant for mistakes.

My whole life once I got back from The City was dedicated to filling the
_hole_ that this girl, this unrequited love had tried and failed to fill. Having
been brought up in a Christian household and having left the Church the moment
my parents stopped making me go, I was drawn towards the Eastern philosophies
of the Tao and Buddhism.

I read and listened to Alan Watts daily. I poured over Western and Eastern
philosphy books, ebbing in and out of each one as I searched for _some answer_,
some _fulfillment_. I was a rabid dog trying to fill an unsatiable desire.
I wasn't understanding anything but I was _searching_ and _trying_.

It was as I was pushing my friend that it _clicked_. All at once but as if
I had known it all along and a _fog had been lifted_ I _understood something_.

This tree I pushed my friend on had a massive trunk with roots weaving in and out
of the dirt around the tree, all the way to the house's foundation. The trunk
split, about 3-4 feet above the ground, into two main segments. Each of those
segments broke into an innumerable amount of branches, each branch with an
innumerable amount of twigs, each twig with an innumerable amount of leaves.

Things made up of Things made up of Things.

Looking at that tree, three questions and their answers became more clear than
they ever had before. And I changed, fundamentally becoming a different person.

### What is a Tree?

If I cut all of the branches off, ripped up the roots and quartered them, splicing
all the leaves into a million pieces, would I still have a tree?
If I just cut it in half _before_ it got to the two large segments, with the
roots below and _everything else_ above, would either piece be a _tree_?

If the tree is _one thing_, a _thing_ that is made up of _other things_, then
when a branch gets diseased and the tree stops sending it nutrients, is that
a _bad_ thing? Is it _bad for the tree_ that all of the leaves die every year?
Is it _bad_ that these living organisms are being destroyed in order for the
_tree_ and _only the tree_ to survive?

### Who Owns the Toe?

When I stub my toe, I think to myself and say outloud

> OH MY GOD! MY TOE HURTS SO BADLY!

I do not say `I hurt so badly`. I say _my toe_.

We _possess_ the toe, we _own_ the toe. But ownership means there is a separation
of the thing being owned and the owner. We possess the _pain_ but we do not say
that the pain is _a part_ of us. We _experience_ it. Who is _experiencing_ and
_what_ are they experiencing?

### What is a Forest?

Just like a tree is a grouping of _things_, a forest is a _thing_ that we associate
with _some grouping of things_. In fact, you cannot have a _tree_ and a _forest_ at
the same time. You can have a _forest_ or you can have _many trees_. Just like you
cannot have a twig and a tree at the same time. To take the twig out of the tree,
it no longer is a tree, it is a twig. Even pointing out a leaf on a tree, the leaf
stops to be _a part_ of the tree and instead becomes _a thing_ separate from the
_other thing_.

Just like a forest, _I am a grouping of things_. Each _thing_ can be dissected
and labeled and named and presented by itself but _none of those things are Me_.
I am _all of those things_ yet I am _a thing_.

All three of these questions keep revealing even deeper and deeper answers the more
I study and search. I am not a teacher but these questions, these _koans_, are what
have guided me for almost 10 years now. Every piece of new information, every new
"epiphany" that I have is filtered through these three questions and their answers.
Each time I do, I find more fulfillment, more enrichment in my life. These koans
and their answers are the _meaning I have found_ that fills that _void_ I was
searching for.

Not to bury the lede but I do not have a good answer for any of those questions. I
have the answer in the way _I understand_ it and these writings are a way for me to
clarify what I _mean_ when I say these answers, but I do not think that I have _any
answers for those questions_ or put better way I don't think that _my answers_ are any
better or worse than _your answers_. In my mind, the _questions_ and the _seeking_
are the actual _thing_ I'm pointing at.

But. A question asked is owed an answer, however unsatisfying.

All three of these questions lead me to believe two things:

- I am not the electrical impulses that course through my nervous system
- You and I are the same thing, in the same way that two trees are a part of
  the same forest

Whatever you and I are, whoever _owns the toe_, we are the _same thing_,
in the same way that the two large segments _are the same tree_, in the same
way that _two trees are a forest_.

## So What?

Philosophy does no good if we cannot take something away from it. Anyone can
spout off $5 words in a sentence that has some punctuation. How might one
want to live given these ideas?

[My previous work](https://timonapath.com/articles/body-politic) outlined the
consequences of this, where the Group is the most important thing, but I want
to dive into that a little deeper and ask a few more questions, hoping to shed
light on the consequences of this way of thinking.

### There Are No Trees

I cannot express this enough: **You are not important**

_**I am not important**_

_**The Tree is important. The Forest is important**_

If the Group is all that matters, my agency is not directed by what makes me _happy_ or
what limits _my_ pain and suffering _as a leaf_. My agency is _that of the Tree_. I am
_nothing outside of the Tree_. _I am nothing but the Tree_. I am _not my toe_, my _toe is me_.

A sick leaf gets nutrients. A hurt leg gets healed. A cancer gets removed. A broken
twig gets blown away. The Tree lives on. The Tree and the outcome of the Tree is what we
_yearn_ for, what we _focus on_, and what we _judge our circumstances against_. We are not
individuals, we are The Group; there are no individuals.

This ideology can, and has, been used to hurt others, to take from others, and to keep others
subjugated to misery and turmoil. Just like the output of photosynthesis can give you diabetes
but also gives life to _everything on earth_, so too can this ideology be used _against_ the
Tree itself. I do not know how to stop that from happening.

I do not know how to design a system that ensures that _when I suffer_ it is purely and
totally for the _Tree's benefit_. I do not have a way to tell you directly what is The Tree
and what is the Branch; I cannot tell you how to discern the needs of the Forest when all you
can hear is the Tree itself yelling; I cannot explain how because I do not know how.

What I can say, and what I have found most helpful, is that _others have asked these questions_.
How to support The Tree, the Self, the One that Is, is all that religion is about.

> I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from
> me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers;
> such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
> ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Fatherâ€™s glory, that you bear much fruit,
> showing yourselves to be my disciples.
>
> Jesus of Nazareth

Search these words, but when you search do not search for _comfort_ or _escape_ from your duties but to
_understand your duties_ as part of the Tree. Meditate daily on what the Tree needs from you today, on
what your body needs from you right now.

### You are a Tree

This _**does not mean**_ that you don't matter. In the previous work, we start from the _foundational_
concept that You have complete agency over You. You _matter_, your feelings are _important and valid_. You
can feel and want and need _whatever it is that you think you want or feel or need_.

I _need_ food and water. I _need_ my wife. I _need_ to be loved.

All of these needs _deserve to be fulfilled_ by any metric of deserve. It is _truly and utterly unfair_ that
you and I do not live in a perfect world without pain, without suffering, without need, without want. We
_should and can_ fight for a world where _we are fulfilled_. You matter and deserve to feel however you want
to feel. However.

There is nothing we can do to _ensure we are fulfilled_. There is nothing we can _push onto others_ that would
make the next moment a given, nothing we can _take from others_ that would give us another minute in our life's
hour glass. We are born without consultation and we die much the same. What makes us think that anything in the
middle would be different?

We are a Tree, with all of its importance. But we are in a Forest, on an Earth, in a Solar System, in a Universe.
The Tree matters just like the grain of sand matters to the beach. The sorrows of the sand are the sorrows of the
beach, the same as your sorrows are that of the universe.

But a Tree must die in order for the Forest to live. A leaf must die in order for the Tree to live. I must die
in order for You to live. We must die in order for Us to live.
